# Current Features

-Decent HTML/CSS (would like someone to review it)<br>
-Event system that supports file uploads (event system is like a linear calendar)<br>
-System in DB for text pages that uses django-precise-bbcode for format<br>
(https://django-precise-bbcode.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)

# Run

Do "pip install django-precise-bbcode" before running.
The BBCode module is used for rendering content from the database.  This may or may not go away.<br>

To run: "python manage.py runserver"<br>
This will run the server on http://127.0.0.1:8000 by default.  Or, specify a custom host:port after runserver in the command.<br>

Or, visit the current build at https://counseling.ptgough.com (Please let Patrick know if it is broken so he can reboot the ptgough.com server).<br>
